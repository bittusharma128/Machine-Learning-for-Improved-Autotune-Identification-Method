# Machine-Learning-for-Improved-Autotune-Identification-Method
A set of general explicit expressions is derived for the identification of a simple transfer function model based on describing function approach. Using these expressions, parameters of transfer function models are obtained. However, due to various dynamic errors, this approach leads to significant errors in determining transfer function model parameters. On the basis of these expressions, a large set of data is generated to train machine learning models for various transfer function models. This procedure is proposed to increase the accuracy of autotune identification method. Simulation examples show promising results by the proposed autotune identification method.

All generated data sets are available in csv file for different transfer function models.

All codes for the project are available in Jupyter notebook files.

Results and  discussions are elaborated in the given PDF file.
